GAME INSTRUCTIONS:

On the game selection screen, enter the size of the maze you want
inside the Row and Col text fields. Do not try to use numbers less than 2
or greater than 13, doing so will make the row and/or col values
default to 2 if lower and 13 if higher. 

Click on the box next to "Use Mouse" to use mouse movement. Leaving
the box unchecked will enable WASD movement.

Clicking the Maze will generate a maze, and clicking on Labyrinth will generate a Labyrinth
(the difference is that a Labyrinth is just a single long path).

You control the red shape, the goal is to get the red shape to the green goal that is placed
somewhere in the maze/labyrinth.

For WASD:
-W to move up
-A to move Left
-D to move right
-S to move down
-Attempting to move into walls will result in you not moving

For Mouse:
-Click to enable/disable controlling the player character/red shape. While enabled, the player
will follow your mouses movements.
-Unlike WASD, you are able to move into walls. Doing this will disable your control over the player and you'll
need to click again.

Clicking on any red X will close the game.
