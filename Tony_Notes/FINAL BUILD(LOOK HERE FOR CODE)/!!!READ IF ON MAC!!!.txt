*I built this on Windows, and there is a small issue Unity has when you build a Mac application on Windows.
To fix, do this:*

Open your terminal, and do:
cd <PATH_TO_UNZIPPED_MACVERSION>/MacBuild

Once you change to that directory, do:
chmod -R 777 MacBuild.app

After running that command, try opening the application. It should work.
If not, let me know and I'll try to further fix or find workarounds for this Unity Issue.
