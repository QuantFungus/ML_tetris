For insight on how to do random maze generation, I spoke with one of my GSAS professors. 
He recommended I try a modified version of the DFS algorithm, some notes on how to go about it:

1. Initialize an n x m grid for the maze, fill each spot with a wall
2. Pick a random initial spot on the maze, label it as "visited" and begin the DFS
3. Look at each neighbor and pick an "unvisited" neighboring spot at random, move to it and label it "visited". Keep track of the path we're making (used in step 5).
4. Repeat the process of picking a random unvisited neighbor
5. If there is a point where we reach a dead end, back track through our recorded path. At each spot we back track too, check to see if there are unvisited spots.
6. If an unvisited spot is eventually found while back tracking (if multiple spots found, pick at random), continue the algorithm on it and keep track of new path
7. Once we hit a dead end and cannot find anymore unvisited spots, we should have a brand new randomly generated maze of the requested n x m size.
